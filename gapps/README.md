Jodd Quickstart: Gapps
=======================

This [Madvoc](http://jodd.org/doc/madvoc/index.html) QuickStart web application
is prepared to be used for Google AppEngine. It contains one significant
configuration that enables running the app locally.

## Build war

Clone this github repo. Invoke:

	gradlew clean
	gradlew war

This will build the whole project and prepare the war file.


## Run web app

You should run it in your IDE or upload it to your AppEngine.

See it [in action](http://jodd-ngn.appspot.com)!

Enjoy!
