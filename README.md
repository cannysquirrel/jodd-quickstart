### madvoc

This is a quick start web application built using
**Madvoc** web framework. **Madvoc** is MVC framework that
uses CoC and annotations in a pragmatic way to simplify
web application development. It is easy to use,
learning curve is small and it is easy to extend.
There are no external (xml) configuration, actions
are simple POJOs, it is compatible with any view
technology, its pluggable and so on...
